And he sent messengers ahead of him, who went and entered a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him; but the people would not receive him, because his face was set toward Jerusalem. And when his disciples James and John saw it, they said, \"Lord, do you want us to bid fire come down from heaven and consume them?\" But he turned and rebuked them. And they went on to another village."
