For nothing is hid that shall not be made manifest, nor anything secret that shall not be known and come to light. Take heed then how you hear; for to him who has will more be given, and from him who has not, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away.\" Then his mother and his brothers came to him, but they could not reach him for the crowd. And he was told, \"Your mother and your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see you.\" But he said to them, \"My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it.\""
