They will receive the greater condemnation.\" He looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury; and he saw a poor widow put in two copper coins. And he said, \"Truly, I tell you, this poor widow has put in more than all of them; for they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in all the living that she had.\" Having said this, he proclaimed, \"He who has ears let him hear.\""
