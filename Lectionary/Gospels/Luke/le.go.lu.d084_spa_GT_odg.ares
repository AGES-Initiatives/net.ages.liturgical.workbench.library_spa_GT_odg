Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus's feet, giving Him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then said Jesus: \"Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?\" And He said to him: \"Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.\""
