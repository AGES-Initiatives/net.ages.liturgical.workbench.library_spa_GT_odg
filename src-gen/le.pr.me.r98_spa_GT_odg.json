If the heaven and the heaven of heaven will not be sufficient for You, how much less even this temple I built in Your name? Yet, O Lord God of Israel, regard my prayer, which Your servant is praying before You today, that Your eyes may be open toward this temple day and night, toward the place of which You said, 'My name shall be there,' to hear the prayer Your servant prays in this place day and night. You will hear the supplication of Your servant and of Your people Israel when they pray toward this place. You will hear in Your dwelling place in heaven, and You will be merciful."'}
